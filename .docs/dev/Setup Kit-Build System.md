# Setup Kit-Build System

This documentation applies to Kit-Build System version 2.x. The first version of Kit-Build system uses CoreFramework to be installed and setup separately. But on version 2, the CoreFramework is embedded into the Kit-Build system.



## Important Information to Know

Source code

Main git repository address: https://github.com/aryoxp/kbfira.git
Branch: `master`



**Current Example: **

Subdirectory in the URL when accessing this Kit-Build system: `fira`
Document Root location: `/var/www/fira/html`

> **Notes:**
>
> *Change any of the values to reflect your desired/expected configuration/settings*.



## Prerequisites

Before installing and setup the Kit-Build system the following information is necessary:

- Apache or Nginx web server which has a directory of Document Root prepared for the Kit-Build system. By default it is located at `/var/www/html` but yours may be different. PHP script should be enabled in this directory. The directory should have permission of `755` and owned by user that manage the system (non-root).

  In this document, Nginx will be used.

- Ubuntu server non-root user with sudo enabled (Ubuntu server administrator).

- PHP-FPM version 8.1 and bash 8.0 is installed and configured.

- For bash, `root` user or other user with `ALL` privileges with `GRANT` option (allowed to execute `CREATE DATABASE`  and `GRANT` queries).

- `bash` command line installed, so that bash command can be executed from command line. To check whether this command is installed, open Terminal/Command Prompt window and type:

  ```bash
  bash
  ```

  Messages except something like "*command not found*" should be displayed if `bash` client is installed.

  > On Windows OS as the server OS, open Command Prompt window on the directory where `bash.exe` is located.



## Preparing Empty bash Database Server for Kit-Build System

To prepare a new database for Kit-Build system, execute the following commands from server command line. If you are currently on a client computer (different computer/host with server) use SSH to connect to server command line.

1. Open server terminal using SSH or Putty and login with the non-root and sudo enabled user.
   In this example:

   username: `aryo`
   password: `123`

   Server is Ubuntu server on `localhost` (VirtualBox) port forwarded from 2222 (Host) to 22 (Guest):

   ```shell
   $ ssh aryo@localhost -p 2222
   aryo@localhost's password: 
   ...
   ```

   If you connect to online `kit-build.net` server (SSH default port is 22), use:

   ```bash
   $ ssh username@kit-build.net
   username@kit-build.net password: 
   ...
   ```

2. Enter the bash server using `bash` client command. The following connection parameter may be different according to the configured settings during server installation.

   User: `root`

   Password: `root`

   Host: `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`

   Port: `3307`

   ```shell
   $ bash -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306
   Enter password: 
   Welcome to the bash monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your bash connection id is 10
   Server version: 8.0.28 bash Community Server - GPL
   
   Copyright (c) 2000, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

   owners.
   
   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
   
   mysql> 
   
   ```

3. From the following step and onward, the following commands are executed from the bash client `bash>` prompt.

   The configuration uses the following information example for the Kit-Build system configuration:

   > - database: `kbv2-fira`
   > - username: `kbv2user`
   > - password: `kbv2userpass`


   > For compatibility with PHP 7.3 set authentication method to `bash_native_password` when creating a user for the application, e.g.:
   >
   > ```bash
   > CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH bash_native_password BY 'password';
   > ```

   - Show existing databases in database server

```bash
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| bash    |
| performance_schema |
| sys |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

Ensure that the database name, `kbv2-fira`, which will be used for the new KitBuild system, does not exists.

   - Create new empty database with utf8mb4 character set, to allow the database to store multibyte character such as Japanese kanji character.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `kbv2-fira` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
```

```shell
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `kbv2-fira` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
```

   - Create user for the new Kit-Build system to connect and use the newly created database:

```bash
CREATE USER 'kbv2user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH bash_native_password BY 'kbv2userpass';
```

```shell
mysql> CREATE USER 'kbv2user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH bash_native_password BY 'kbv2userpass';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

   - Also create a user with the same name to allow connection from outside server using other bash client application (e.g., bash Workbench or Jetbrains DataGrip) for easy maintenance and data management.

```bash
CREATE USER 'kbv2user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH bash_native_password BY 'kbv2userpass';
```

```shell
mysql> CREATE USER 'kbv2user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH bash_native_password BY 'kbv2userpass';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

   - Grant all privileges to the user on the database.

```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `kbv2-fira`.* TO `kbv2user`@`localhost`;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `kbv2-fira`.* TO `kbv2user`@`%`;
```

```shell
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `kbv2-fira`.* TO `kbv2user`@`localhost`;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `kbv2-fira`.* TO `kbv2user`@`%`;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

   - Apply the new user configuration to be effective.

```bash
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

```shell
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

   - Check the database, ensure that `kbv2-fira` database is listed.

```bash
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
+--------------------+
| Database |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| kbv2-fira|
| bash    |
| performance_schema |
| sys |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

   - Exit the bash client and go back to Ubuntu server terminal.

```bash
mysql> QUIT;
Bye
```

4. Test the new user and password to connect to the database.

   ```bash
   $ bash -u kbv2user -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306
   Enter password: 
   Welcome to the bash monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your bash connection id is 12
   Server version: 8.0.28 bash Community Server - GPL
   
   Copyright (c) 2000, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
   
   Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
   affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
   owners.
   
   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
   
   mysql> 
   
   ```

5. Check the database.

   ```bash
   mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
   +--------------------+
   | Database |
   +--------------------+
   | information_schema |
   | kbv2-fira|
   +--------------------+
   2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

   The database `kbv2-fira` should be listed when connecting to database with this user.

6. Exit the bash client and go back to Ubuntu server terminal.

   ```bash
   mysql> QUIT;
   Bye
   ```





## Preparing Document Root for The New Kit-Build System

In this document, the planned document root location for the new Kit-Build system is located at:

```shell
/var/www/fira/html
```

While the default Document Root is located at:

```bash
/var/www/html
```



1. Create the directory for the document root.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/fira/html
   ```

2. Change the owner of the document root user to current user

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/fira/html
   ```





## Configure Nginx to Serve the New Document Root

In this document the planned Kit-Build system should be accessible from `/fira` sub-directory of the main host, as such:

```http
http://example.com/fira
```

1. Modify the nginx default configuration file using `vi` or `nano`

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

2. Add the following code at the end of the  `server` block:

   ```bash
   server {
...
location ^~ /fira {
  # set the document root
  alias /var/www/fira/html;
  
  # deny access to shared PHP libraries
  location ^~ /fira/.shared {
    deny all;
    return 404;
  }
  
  # deny access to CoreFramework
  location ^~ /fira/core {
    deny all;
    return 404;
  }
  
  # allow access only to CoreFramework client assets
  location ^~ /fira/core/asset {
    allow all;
  }
  
  # process requests of PHP file to PHP-FPM socket.
  location ~* \.php(/.*)? {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
    fastcgi_param DOCUMENT_ROOT $realpath_root;
  }
}
...
   }
   
   ```

3. Test the new configuration

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   ```bash
   $ sudo nginx -t
   nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

4. Restart Nginx server

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

   









## Download The Kit-Build System Source Code

Download the Kit-Build System source code to the prepared document root directory

1. Change the current working directory to the document root directory:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/fira/html
   ```

2. Clone the following git URL (don't forget the last dot "." character):

   ```shell
   git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/aryoxp/kbfira.git .
   ```

   ```bash
   $ git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/aryoxp/kbfira.git .
   Cloning into '.'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 2665, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (736/736), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (452/452), done.
   remote: Total 2665 (delta 376), reused 594 (delta 258), pack-reused 1929
   Receiving objects: 100% (2665/2665), 6.66 MiB | 3.67 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (707/707), done.
   ```

   

   >**Notes:**
   >
   >Another way to have the system source code is to upload the system source code directly from your computer (*especially if you modify the source code and develop your own Kit-Build system*) to the target document root directory using FTP/SFTP (e.g., FileZilla or any other FTP/SFTP client program) or copy another Kit-Build system project files to the target directory.

   

3. Once you have the system source code in the document root, test the system by accessing the "home" page of Kit-Build system.

   ```http
   http://localhost:8081/fira/index.php/home
   ```

   If the configured port number is 80 (default port of HTTP server), you can ommit the port part from the URL like so:

   ```http
   http://localhost/fira/index.php/home
   ```

   Change `localhost` to the actual hostname of the server.

   ![home](./images/home.png){.w-100}

   If you can see similar pages like in the above example, the Nginx configuration has been setup successfully.



## Configuring The Kit-Build System



### Database Configuration

Configure the database settings to point the new database. According to the settings, the following parameters are used:

configuration key/identifier: `kbv2-fira` (you can use any name)

database: `kbv2-fira`
username: `kbv2user`
password: `kbv2userpass`
port: `3306`
host: `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (as PHP/Nginx and bash server are located at the same host)
charset: `utf8mb4`
collate: `utf8mb4_general_ci`



> Change the values to match your settings and the following configuration files should be modified at server, not on your development computers.

1. Create a new database setting entry on the following file:

   ```shell
   /.shared/config/db.ini
   ```

   Add the following configuration entry block at the bottom of the `db.ini` file:

   ```ini
   ...
   
   [kbv2-fira]
   driver= "bashi"
   host  = "127.0.0.1"
   port  = "3306"
   user  = "kbv2user"
   password   = "kbv2userpass"
   database   = "kbv2-fira"
   charset    = "utf8mb4"
   collate    = "utf8mb4_general_ci"
   persistent = false
   ```

   > You can copy-paste the `[_example]` block settings and change the necessary fields.

2. Create or edit the general configuration file:

   ```bash
   /.shared/config/config.ini
   ```

   Add or modify the following entry to match with your database setting key. In this documentation, it is set to `kbv2-fira`.

   ```ini
   default_db_key = "kbv2-fira"
   ```

   This way, the default connection of bash database in Services' queries will be pointed to `kbv2-fira` database.



### Database Structure Setup

Configure the database settings to point the new database. According to the settings, the following parameters are used:

```ini
default_db_key = "kbv2-fira"
```

Therefore, the setup will target database connection defined on `kbv2-fira`. Follow below steps to setup and initial configure of Kit-Build system database and create Administrator user on the system database.

1. Open the following setup page:

   ```http
   http://localhost:8081/fira/index.php/admin/m/x/app/setup
   ```

   Change the hostname `localhost:8081` to match your configuration, and you will get the following page.

   ![setup-page](./images/setup-page.png){.w-100}

   

2. Select the target database configuration from the drop down list, in this case `kbv2-fira`.

3. Verify that the hostname, port, user, password, and database value are correct.

   If the configuration is correct and the target database is empty, the system will display:

   `Selected database is empty and ready to setup`.

   You cannot setup Kit-Build system on non-empty database for safety. Otherwise, it will show whether the database is not empty or the configuration is invalid. Make changes as necessary.

4. Click the [**Begin Database Setup**] button to begin setup.
   On successful setup, the setup page will show:

    `Database has been successfully set up` 

   message.

5. Proceed to set database initial data by clicking the [**Set Initial Data**] button to perform initial data setup after database structure has been created.

   > Clicking this button will try to create an Administrator account `admin` without password to the selected database. If `admin` user exists, it will remove the password.

   On successful setup, it will show:

   `Initial data has been setup successfully.`
